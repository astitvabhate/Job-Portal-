so im starting this project where i want to 
  Build a basic Job Board where companies can post jobs and users can browse them.


  uploading this on github so anyone can access it. 

 insitialling the project starting with Frontend and then moving to backend 
 setting up the project with React and Tailwind CSS for styling. 
 
 
 setup done 
 

 frontend for Home page where job listings are displayed in grid form.

  made a basic layout of form where companies can post jobs.

  if anyone clicks on a view button it will take them to a page where they can see the details of the job.
  also added a search bar to filter jobs based on title or company name.

  so far the frontend is looking good.

  now moving to the backend part of the project where i will set up a Node.js server with Express. (after some time)
